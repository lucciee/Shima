# Shima
A flappy-bird based game featuring the shimaenaga, a bird that looks like a flying cotton ball. Help Shime brave the rough winds!
As the first game I've ever created, this project was very challenging but also very rewarding. Although the game is *very* simple, I got to learn a lot about kinematics in game development.
